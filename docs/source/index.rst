afterglowpy
===========

*afterglowpy* is a Python package for modelling Gamma-ray burst afterglows. It computes synchrotron radiation from an external shock and is capable of handling both structured jets and off-axis observers.

For details of the physics, approximations, and numerical implementation please see `Ryan et al. 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11691>`_.

You can install *afterglowpy* with pip::

    $ pip install afterglowpy

This documentation is still a little thin.  Please read the Quickstart, check out the examples on Github: `<https://github.com/geoffryan/afterglowpy>`_, and contact the author if you have any questions or issues.
