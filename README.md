# Numeric GRB Afterglow models

A Python 3 module to calculate GRB afterglow light curves and spectra. Details of the methods can be found in [Ryan et al 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896..166R/abstract). Builds on [van Eerten & MacFadyen 2010](https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5125) and [van Eerten 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01848).  This code is under active development.

## Attribution

If you use this code in a publication, please refer to the package by name and cite "Ryan, G., van Eerten, H., Piro, L. and Troja, E., 2020, Astrophysical Journal *896*, 166 (2020)" [arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11691).

## Features

_afterglowpy_ computes synchrotron emission from the forward shock of a relativistic blast wave.  It includes:
- Fully trans-relativistic shock evolution through a constant density medium.
- On-the-fly integration over the equal-observer-time slices of the shock surface.
- Approximate prescription for jet spreading.
- Arbitrary viewing angles.
- Angularly structured jets, ie. E(&theta;)
- Spherical velocity-stratified outflows, ie. E(u)
- Counter-jet emission.

It has limited support (these should be considered experimental) for:
- Initial energy injection
- Inverse comption spectra
- Spatially-resolved intensity maps
- Early coasting phase

It does not include (yet):
- External wind medium, ie. n &prop; r<sup>-2</sup>
- Synchrotron self-absorbtion
- Reverse shock emission

_afterglowpy_ has been calibrated to the BoxFit code ([van Eerten, van der Horst, & Macfadyen 2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5089), available at the [Afterglow Library](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/afterglowlibrary/boxfit2011.html)) and produces similar light curves for top hat jets (within 50% when same parameters are used) both on- and off-axis.  Its jet models by default do not include an initial coasting phase, which may effect predictions for early observations.

## Installation/Building


_afterglowpy_ is available via `pip`:
```bash
$ pip install afterglowpy
```

If you are working on a local copy of this repo and would like to install from source, you can the run the following from the top level directory of the project.
```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

## Using

In your python code, import the library with `import afterglowpy as grb`.  

The main function of interest is`grb.fluxDensity(t, nu, jetType, specType, **kwargs)`.  See `tests/plotLC.py` for a simple example.

`jetType` is an integer code setting the jet structure. It can be `grb.jet.TopHat` (-1, top hat), `grb.jet.Gaussian` (0, Gaussian), `grb.jet.PowerLawCore` (1, Power Law w/ core), `grb.jet.GaussianCore` (2, Gaussian w/ core), `grb.jet.Spherical` (3, Spherical Cocoon), or `grb.jet.PowerLaw` (4, Smooth Power Law).  

`specType` can be 0 (global cooling time, no inverse compton) or 1 (global cooling time, inverse compton).

For jet-like afterglows (`jetTypes` -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 4) `pars` has 11 required keyword arguments:
- `thetaObs` viewing angle in radians
- `E0` on-axis isotropic equivalent energy in erg
- `thetaCore` half-width of the jet core in radians (jetType specific)
- `thetaWing` "wing" truncation angle of the jet, in radians
- `b` power for power-law structure, &theta;<sup>-b</sup>
- `n0` Number density of ISM, in cm<sup>-3</sup>
- `p` Electron distribution power-law index (p>2)
- `epsilon_e` Thermal energy fraction in electrons
- `epsilon_B` Thermal energy fraction in magnetic field
- `xi_N` Fraction of electrons that get accelerated
- `d_L` Luminosity distance in cm

For cocoon-like afterglows (`jetType` 3) `pars` has 14 positional arguments:
- `uMax` Initial maximum outflow 4-velocity
- `uMin` Minium outflow 4-velocity
- `Er` Fiducial energy in velocity distribution, E(>u) = E<sub>i</sub>  u<sup>-k</sup>.
- `k` Power-law index of energy velocity distribution  
- `MFast_solar` Mass of material at `uMax' in solar masses
- `n0` Number density of ISM, in cm<sup>-3</sup>
- `p` Electron distribution power-law index (p>2)
- `epsilon_e` Thermal energy fraction in electrons
- `epsilon_B` Thermal energy fraction in magnetic field
- `xi_N` Fraction of electrons that get accelerated
- `d_L` Luminosity distance in cm

Optional keyword arguments for all models are:
- `z` redshift (defaults to 0)
- `L0` Fiducial luminosity for energy injection, in erg/s, default 0.0.
- `q` Temporal power-law index for energy injection, default 0.0.
- `ts` Fiducial time-scale for energy injection, in seconds, default 0.
- `tRes` time resolution of shock-evolution scheme, number of sample points per decade in time
- `latRes` latitudinal resolution for structured jets, number of shells per `thetaC`
- `rtol` target relative tolerance of flux integration
- `spread` boolean (defaults to True), whether to allow the jet to spread.
